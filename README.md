Problem Statement

Goal: What is the core problem you are trying to solve in the VR gaming space?

Keep it concrete. Example: “VR users lack intuitive hand-tracking controls in multiplayer settings.”

Why it matters:

Explain the broader context and impact. Who cares, and why?

Core Assumptions

List all assumptions underpinning your roadmap. These must be explicit so you can test them later. Examples:

Users have access to VR hardware X.

Motion controllers are precise to 2 mm.

Multiplayer VR latency can’t exceed 50 ms.

First-Principles Analysis

Break down your problem to its most fundamental truths. Ignore current solutions, market constraints, or conventions. Example:

VR interactions = user input → system reaction.

Motion capture accuracy = physical sensor limits.

Immersion = latency + visual fidelity + haptic feedback.

Primitive Workflow / Prototype Steps

A step-by-step, achievable plan to test your assumptions without overcommitting. Example:

Step 0: Define MVP Scope

What is the minimum feature set that validates your idea?

Step 1: Acquire Tools / Tech

List exact software/hardware needed. Keep costs realistic.

Step 2: Create Conceptual Prototype

Not fully functional. Focus on demonstrating feasibility.

Step 3: Test Core Mechanics

What can you measure to validate your first principles assumptions?

Step 4: Gather Feedback / Iterate

Conduct small-scale user tests, record results, and refine.

Tip: Only move to Step N+1 if Step N proves the assumption correct or clarifies the path forward.

Resource Map

Map everything you’ll need—time, money, people, tech, data. Example:

Hardware: VR headset, motion controllers

Software: Unity/Unreal, hand-tracking SDK

Skills Needed: 3D modeling, VR programming, UX testing

Estimated Cost: $X for prototype

Metrics for Success

Define measurable outcomes for each stage. Example:

Prototype hand-tracking accuracy ≥ 90%

Latency ≤ 50 ms

User retention after 15 minutes ≥ 70%

Next Steps

Clear, actionable steps with priorities. Example:

 Acquire VR headset and controllers

 Build minimal VR scene

 Implement basic hand-tracking

 Conduct first 5 user tests

Risks & Unknowns

List what could break the roadmap or assumptions. Example:

Hardware performance limitations

Unforeseen software bugs

User adoption lower than expected
